Project nr. 16 / 21 - made during the Technigo Bootcamp

# Project Labyrinth
This is a project made during the Technigo bootcamp. The aim was to build a game in React using Redux, fetching a list of actions from the backend and presenting them to the user as interactable items. 

## The problem
We made a responsive site that displays different images depending on size of device and, different design for the first page and the game. We added a button to restart the game and one to go back to the previous description, but we've had some issues with the back-button so currently that doesn't work.  

## Techs used:
* JSX
* CSS
* React
* Redux
* Design (responsive)
* Pair programming
